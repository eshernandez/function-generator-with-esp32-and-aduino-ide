# Functions generator with esp32 and arduino ide
this project was developed with a esp32 development module and arduino ide. His function is generate basic signals with  internal dac (digital analog converter).

## Functionality

* Esp32 has two GPIO with DAC and they are: dac1; 25, dac2; 26.
* Output DAC
  * dacWrite(): is the function that controls the output of the DAC, it   receives two dacWrite input parameters (pinOutput, signalFuncion ), the DAC has   an 8 bit resolution ...
